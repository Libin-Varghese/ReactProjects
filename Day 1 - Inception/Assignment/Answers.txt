1. What is Emmet?
- Helps you write HTML and CSS faster by using simple abbreviations that are then converted into code blocks.

2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
Library :
- When using a library, the programmer decides when and where to call it.

FrameWork :
- It provides the basic framework and tells the programmer what is needed. Accordingly, the necessary code is inserted by the developer and supplements the framework according to the desired function. In the end, however, it is the framework that calls up the code when it needs it and is also responsible for the running of the programme.

3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
- A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.
- By having servers that cache content close to the location(s) of end users, CDNs minimize latency, speeding up load times for websites, applications, and downloads.
